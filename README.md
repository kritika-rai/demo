The data science project walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. I first built a model using sklearn and linear regression using USA_california dataset. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Technology and tools wise this project covers:

1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Google Colab as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS for UI
